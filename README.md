# Young Startups Hackathon 2015

The idea behind this project is to make YoungStartups more efficient / useful to those 
new to the group and for those looking to network in specific areas. The following 
document maps out how I belive this should be done and will hopefully form the basis 
of our Young Startups Hackathon entry.

## The Spec

* Allow new users to sign up for Young Startups. These must be approved by an 
admin at some point down the track. When users are approved:
  1. They get access to the 'YoungStartups directory'.
  2. They are auto-invited to Slack (speak to NickV about getting access to this).
* The Young Startups directory should have a list of members with the following info:
  1. What they're working on at the time.
  2. What they're looking for (be that skills from other users).
  3. Tips / Recommendations to other members in the group. This may or may not take
     the form of an internal / mini blog.
* When a member updates their profile with what they're looking for - it would be 
great if a Slack bot could be created to enable notifications to hit the slack channel.
This works twofold - it encourages / reminds people about the site - but it also 
provides additional value to the slack channel itself (which will most likely always
be the main selling point to Young Startups).


## Design

Paul is working on designing up some mockups right now.

## Development

Stefan / Henry are working on this. It would be great if this can take shape in the
form of an API backend and pure JS frontend but not a biggy.
